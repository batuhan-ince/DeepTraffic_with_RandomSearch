# DeepTraffic_with_RandomSearch
Random Search algorithm implementation for MIT's  Deep Traffic

We tried to optimize hyperparameters for DeepTraffic (https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic).
We achieved to reach 72.9 mph with Random Search. We will publish paper about this and another good algorithms soon.
Stay tuned...
